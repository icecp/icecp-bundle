This package contains the classes necessary for using the <a href="https://github.intel.com/iSPA/icecp-module-storage">storage
    module</a> as the underlying storage mechanism. A {@link com.intel.icecp.bundle.messages.StorageClient} is provided
for abstracting all RPC calls to the module. The bundle implementations ({@link
com.intel.icecp.bundle.messages.MessageBundle}, {@link com.intel.icecp.bundle.messages.MessageBatch}, and {@link
com.intel.icecp.bundle.messages.MessageItem}) use this client to retrieve stored messages and then delete them as they
are marked finished. Because the storage module stores messages in sessions, an explicit three-tiered naming structure
is used: instead of just generic bundles at each level, messages are represented as MessageItems, sessions as
MessageBatches,
and collections of sessions (i.e. what a module would use) as MessageBundles.
