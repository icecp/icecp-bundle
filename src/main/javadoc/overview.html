This library exists to retrieve ICECP messages either in bundles or individually. It provides a mechanism for marking
messages as finished so they can be removed from the underlying storage mechanism. Though no storage mechanism is
dictated, the initial implementation is for interaction with the <a
        href="https://github.com/icecp/icecp-module-storage">storage module</a>. See the {@code messages} package
for more details.
